[The Butterfly SDK](https://github.com/TheButterflyButton/About/blob/main/README.md) helps your app to take an active part in the fight against domestic violence.

## Installation
### üîå & ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Install via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/butterfly_sdk_flutter_plugin)

```
  butterfly_sdk_flutter_plugin: ^2.0.2
```

## Usage

To recognize your app in TheButterflySDK servers you'll need an application key. You can set it via code, as demonstrated here.

### Example in Dart

```Dart
import 'package:butterfly_sdk_flutter_plugin/butterfly_sdk_flutter_plugin.dart';

// Whenever you wish to open our screen, simply call:
ButterflySdk.openReporter(withKey: "your API key");
```

## Integration test
#### How?
You can easily verify your application key üîë by simply running the plugin in **DEBUG mode** üêû.

This will cause our servers to skip the part of sending reports to real live support centers, they will only verify the API key. Eventually you'll get success / failure result.

### Enjoy and good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
